# MatrixRate for Magento 2
The MatrixRate shipping extension is the original Magento solution developed by [ShipperHQ](https://shipperhq.com) that enables you to offer multiple shipping options to customers based on their location. MatrixRate will enable you to define different shipping rates according to destination, shipping method and the weight, price or quantity of an item.

For businesses seeking even greater shipping customization and real-time carrier integrations, consider upgrading to [ShipperHQ](https://shipperhq.com).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Can I set up free shipping for specific conditions?
Yes, you can define a `Shipping Price` of `0.00` in the CSV file for specific conditions, such as orders over a certain amount.

### 2. What happens if no rules match?
If no rules match the customerâ€™s criteria, MatrixRate will not display a shipping method. Ensure you have a fallback rule if needed.

### 3. How do I troubleshoot issues with rates?
- Check our troubleshooting guide in the [ShipperHQ documentation](https://docs.shipperhq.com/troubleshooting-matrixrates/).
- Check the Magento logs for errors: `var/log/system.log` and `var/log/exception.log`.

## Credits
This extension borrows heavily from the Tablerate capability in Magento2.  In order to keep codebase as bug-free and
conformant as possible the tablerate code is used in preference to writing from scratch.  This hopefully also
allows for easier understanding by users.

We would like to acknowledge and thank the Magento 2 Development team for making their codebase open for such use.

The composer structure is taken from various sources, most heavily using structure from https://github.com/sjparkinson/static-review.

Assistance around composer, Magento2 structure, etc was also taken from these sources:

* [https://github.com/Genmato/MultiStoreSearchFields](http://)
* [https://alankent.wordpress.com/2014/08/03/creating-a-magento-2-composer-module/](http://)
* [https://github.com/SchumacherFM/mage2-advanced-rest-permissions](http://)
